# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

## Demo
You can try the game by visiting the live demo here <a href="">Caro Game</a>.

## Installation
Step 1: Clone the Repository
Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/SamNguyen228/Tic_Tac_Toe.git
cd Tic_Tac_Toe

Step 2: Install Dependencies
Use npm (or yarn) to install the necessary project dependencies:

npm install

Step 3: Run the Development Server
Once the dependencies are installed, start the development server:

npm run dev

This will launch the development server, and you can access the game at: http://localhost:5173

Step 4: Build the Project for Production
To create a production-ready build of the project, run:

npm run build

The production build will be placed in the dist folder. You can then deploy this folder to your preferred hosting service.
